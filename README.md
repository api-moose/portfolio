# SvelteKit Portfolio

This is an implementation of a portfolio website built by [Mustafa Masud](https://github.com/api-moose) with Sveltekit.

_Live Example: https://masud.io_

## Deploy Your Own

I deployed this with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` to start a development server, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
